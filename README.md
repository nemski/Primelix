```

# Background and approach

This was written as an exercise in learning Elixir and recursive algorithms. Many years ago one of the first programs I ever wrote (in C) was a prime number generator. There is a simple rule that can be followed to quickly find if a number is a prime; is the number divisible by any other prime number?
